# 🏠 Home Server Lab – Fedora, Docker, VPN & Private Cloud

This is an **ongoing personal project** where I’m building a self-hosted home server on **Fedora 41** to deploy and secure various services using Docker, reverse proxies, and VPNs. The goal is to simulate real-world IT infrastructure, improve my skills in system and network administration, and host reliable private cloud services.

This lab continues to evolve as I test new tools, implement better security practices, and add new services over time.
